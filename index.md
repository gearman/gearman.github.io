# What is Gearman?

Gearman provides a generic application framework to farm out work to other
machines or processes that are better suited to do the work. It allows you to
do work in parallel, to load balance processing, and to call functions between
languages. It can be used in a variety of applications, from high-availability
web sites to the transport of database replication events. In other words, it
is the nervous system for how distributed processing communicates. A few strong
points about Gearman:

* **Open Source** It's free! (in both meanings of the word) Gearman has an
  active open source community that is easy to get involved with if you need
  help or want to contribute. Worried about licensing? Gearman is BSD.
* **Multi-language** - There are interfaces for a number of languages, and
  this list is growing. You also have the option to write heterogeneous
  applications with clients submitting work in one language and workers
  performing that work in another.
* **Flexible** - You are not tied to any specific design pattern. You can
  quickly put together distributed applications using any model you choose,
  one of those options being Map/Reduce.
* **Fast** - Gearman has a simple protocol and interface with an optimized,
  and threaded, server written in C/C++ to minimize your application overhead.
* **Embeddable** - Since Gearman is fast and lightweight, it is great for
  applications of all sizes. It is also easy to introduce into existing
  applications with minimal overhead.
* **No single point of failure** - Gearman can not only help scale systems,
  but can do it in a fault tolerant way.
* **No limits on message size** - Gearman supports single messages up to 4gig
  in size. Need to do something bigger? No problem Gearman can chunk messages.
* **Worried about scaling?** - Don't worry about it with Gearman. Craig's

# How Does Gearman Work?

A Gearman powered application consists of three parts: a client, a worker, and
a job server. The client is responsible for creating a job to be run and sending
it to a job server. The job server will find a suitable worker that can run the
job and forwards the job on. The worker performs the work requested by the
client and sends a response to the client through the job server. Gearman
provides client and worker APIs that your applications call to talk with the
Gearman job server (also known as gearmand) so you don't need to deal with
networking or mapping of jobs. Internally, the gearman client and worker APIs
communicate with the job server using TCP sockets. To explain how Gearman works
in more detail, lets look at a simple application that will reverse the order of
characters in a string. The example is given in PHP, although other APIs will
look quite similar.

We start off by writing a client application that is responsible for sending off
the job and waiting for the result so it can print it out. It does this by using
the Gearman client API to send some data associated with a function name, in
this case the function `reverse`. The code for this is (with error handling
omitted for brevity):

{% highlight php %}
<?php
// Reverse Client Code
$client = new GearmanClient();
$client->addServer();
print $client->doNormal("reverse", "Hello World!");
{% endhighlight %}

This code initializes a client class, configures it to use a job server with
`add_server` (no arguments means use `127.0.0.1` with the default port), and then
tells the client API to run the `reverse` function with the workload
"Hello world!". The function name and arguments are completely arbitrary as far
as Gearman is concerned, so you could send any data structure that is
appropriate for your application (text or binary). At this point the Gearman
client API will package up the job into a Gearman protocol packet and send it to
the job server to find an appropriate worker that can run the `reverse`
function. Let's now look at the worker code:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
// Reverse Worker Code
$worker = new GearmanWorker();
$worker->addServer();
$worker->addFunction("reverse", function ($job) {
  return strrev($job->workload());
});
while ($worker->work());
{% endhighlight %}

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/flow.png" alt="Gearman Flow"
     style="float: right; padding: 5px 0px 5px 10px;">

This code defines a function `my_reverse_function` that takes a string and
returns the reverse of that string. It is used by a worker object to register a
function named `reverse` after it is setup to connect to the same local job
server as the client. When the job server receives the job to be run, it looks
at the list of workers who have registered the function name `reverse` and
forwards the job on to one of the free workers. The Gearman worker API then
takes this request, runs the function `my_reverse_function`, and sends the
result of that function back through the job server to the client.

As you can see, the client and worker APIs (along with the job server) deal with
the job management and network communication so you can focus on the application
parts. There a few different ways you can run jobs in Gearman, including
background for asynchronous processing and prioritized jobs. See the
[documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/) available for the various APIs
for details.

# How Is Gearman Useful?

The reverse example above seems like a lot of work to run a function, but there
are a number of ways this can be useful. The simplest answer is that you can use
Gearman as an interface between a client and a worker written in different
languages. If you want your PHP web application to call a function written in C,
you could use the PHP client API with the C worker API, and stick a job server
in the middle. Of course, there are more efficient ways of doing this (like
writing a PHP extension in C), but you may want a PHP client and a Python
worker, or perhaps a MySQL client and a Perl worker. You can mix and match any
of the supported language interfaces easily, you just need all applications to
be able to understand the workload being sent. Is your favorite language not
supported yet? Get [involved with the project]({{ site.baseurl }}/communication/),
it's probably fairly easy for either you or one of the existing Gearman
developers to put a language wrapper on top of the C library.

The next way that Gearman can be useful is to put the worker code on a separate
machine (or cluster of machines) that are better suited to do the work. Say
your PHP web application wants to do image conversion, but this is too much
processing to run it on the web server machines. You could instead ship the
image off to a separate set of worker machines to do the conversion, this way
the load does not impact the performance of your web server and other PHP
scripts. By doing this, you also get a natural form of load balancing since the
job server only sends new jobs to idle workers. If all the workers running on
a given machine are busy, you don't need to worry about new jobs being sent
there. This makes scale-out with multi-core servers quite simple: do you have
16 cores on a worker machine? Start up 16 instances of your worker (or
perhaps more if they are not CPU bound). It is also seamless to add new
machines to expand your worker pool, just boot them up, install the worker
code, and have them connect to the existing job server.

Now you're probably asking what if the job server dies? You are able to run
multiple job servers and have the clients and workers connect to the first
available job server they are configured with. This way if one job server dies,
clients and workers automatically fail over to another job server. You probably
don't want to run too many job servers, but having two or three is a good idea
for redundancy. The diagram to the left shows how a simple Gearman cluster
may look.

From here, you can scale out your clients and workers as needed. The job servers
can easily handle having hundreds of clients and workers connected at once. You
can draw your own physical (or virtual) machine lines where capacity allows,
potentially distributing load to any number of machines. For more details on
specific uses and installations, see the section on [examples]({{ site.baseurl }}/examples/).
