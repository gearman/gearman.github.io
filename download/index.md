# Overview

There are a few options when it comes to choosing a job server and API. Gearman
has benefited from many active open source contributors who have each introduced
a new project or helped out with an existing one. Some projects are more active
than others, each have varying features and performance, but they are all
compatible with one another (except for some new protocol additions). If you
need help figuring out which option would best suit your needs,
[get in touch!]({{ site.baseurl }}/communication/)

# Job Server (gearmand)

## gearmand (C)

A job server written in C/C++ under the BSD license that contains all of the
latest protocol additions. Development for this is very active, with threading,
persistent queues, and pluggable protocols now supported. Replication and better
statistics reporting are coming soon. This installs an executable called
`gearmand` (usually in /usr/local/sbin). The C library, libgearman, is bundled
in the same package.

 * [1.1.13 and later releases are on Github](https://github.com/gearman/gearmand/releases)
 * [pre 1.1.13 releases are on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/gearmand)

## Gearman Java Service (Java)

A java implementation that is both the gearman library and a standalone
job server.

 * Gearman Java Service on [GitHub](https://github.com/gearman/java-service)

## Gearman::Server (Perl)

The original Perl job server that can be found on CPAN as Gearman::Server.
This installs an executable called 'gearmand' (usually in /usr/local/bin).

 * [Perl modules on CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Gearman-Server/)

# Client & Worker APIs

## libgearman (C)

The C client & worker API under BSD license that can be found in the same
package as the C server. This library is closely tied with the gearmand C job
server, sharing low level connection and protocol code.

 * [Gearman server and library](http://launchpad.net/gearmand/)
   [(Source)](https://launchpad.net/gearmand)

## Shell

This is included as part of the gearmand and libgearman package above. This tool
allows you to run Gearman clients and workers from the command line or in shell
scripts. This is installed as an executable called `gearman` (usually in /usr/local/bin).

## Perl

There are three Perl client implementations, two of which are Pure Perl and one
which is a wrapper around the libgearman C library.

### Gearman::XS

A Perl module that wraps the libgearman C library. On CPAN under
[Gearman::XS](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Gearman-XS/).

 * [Gearman::XS (0.12)](http://launchpad.net/gearmanxs/trunk/0.12/+download/Gearman-XS-0.12.tar.gz)

### Gearman::Client & ::Worker

This pure Perl API can be found in CPAN under Gearman::Client
and Gearman::Worker.

 *  [Perl modules on CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Gearman/)

### AnyEvent::Gearman::Client & ::Worker

This pure Perl API can be found in CPAN under [AnyEvent::Gearman::Client](http://search.cpan.org/dist/AnyEvent-Gearman-Client)
and [AnyEvent::Gearman::Worker](http://search.cpan.org/dist/AnyEvent-Gearman-Worker).

A simpler API can be found under [AnyEvent::Gearman](http://search.cpan.org/dist/AnyEvent-Gearman).

This module uses the [AnyEvent](http://search.cpan.org/dist/AnyEvent) framework
and provides a event-driven asynchronous client and worker.

## Nodejs

## PHP

There are two PHP client/worker libraries, one which is a pure PHP extension and
one which wraps the libgearman C library.

### Gearman Extension

A PHP extension that wraps the libgearman C library.

 * [PHP Extension Reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/php-client-libraries/extension/reference/)

### Net_Gearman

A pure PHP API that can be found as Net_Gearman on PEAR.

### GearmanBundle

   (for [Symfony2](http://symfony.com))

## Python

There are three different Python APIs, one that is a wrapper of the libgearman C
library and two that are pure Python. There is also a package for Django.

### Pure Python

Two pure-Python API's can be found on PyPI, "gearman" and "gear". They can be installed with "pip install gearman".

 * [gearman](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gearman) - Basic client library
 * [gear](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gear) - Async client library and basic server in python

### Python C Library Wrapper

A python library that wraps the C interface library.

## Java

### Java Gearman Service

"Java gearman service" is a asynchronous interface written entirely in java.
This includes client, worker, and server implementations. java-gearman-service
can be downloaded at Google Code
